    <h2>Claim 1: Regulation is Necessary to Mitigate AI's Negative Consequences</h2>

    <section>
        <p>While Artificial Intelligence offers tremendous benefits, unregulated development poses serious risks to society. 
        One of the most pressing concerns is the displacement of workers across multiple industries, as AI and automation systems outperform human labor in repetitive or routine tasks. 
        According to the McKinsey Global Institute (2017), as many as 800 million jobs could be displaced globally by 2030, with lower-income and less-educated workers facing the greatest vulnerabilities. 
        Without intervention, the economic and social consequences could lead to greater inequality, community destabilization, and loss of trust in technological progress. 
        Regulation is essential to ensure that workers are protected through retraining programs and that technological disruption does not widen societal divides.</p>

        <p>Beyond economic impacts, AI systems have been shown to reinforce biases when trained on historical or imbalanced data. 
        A study by the MIT Media Lab (2018) found that facial recognition algorithms misidentified darker-skinned and female faces at significantly higher rates, raising concerns about systemic discrimination. 
        Furthermore, AI's increasing role in sensitive areas like policing, hiring, and healthcare necessitates stringent oversight to prevent harm. 
        Regulatory frameworks that mandate transparency, explainability, and fairness can help ensure that AI is aligned with democratic values and human rights. 
        Without proactive governance, AI could unintentionally amplify prejudice, reduce accountability, and erode public trust in both technology and institutions.</p>

        <h3>Key Reasons for AI Regulation:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Job Displacement:</strong> Up to 800 million workers could be displaced by 2030 (McKinsey, 2017).</li>
            <li><strong>Algorithmic Bias:</strong> AI systems have exhibited racial and gender biases in hiring, facial recognition, and criminal justice applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Privacy and Data Risks:</strong> AI-driven surveillance and data misuse threaten individual rights.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Threats:</strong> Poorly secured AI systems can be exploited for cyberattacks and misinformation campaigns.</li>
            <li><strong>Public Trust:</strong> Transparent and fair regulation builds public confidence in emerging technologies.</li>
        </ul>
