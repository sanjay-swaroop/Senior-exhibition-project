    <h2>Claim 2: Over-Regulation Could Hinder AI's Potential Benefits</h2>

    <section>
        <p>While regulatory oversight is necessary, excessive or poorly designed regulation could severely stifle innovation and limit the transformative potential of Artificial Intelligence. 
        Strict compliance costs and burdensome legal frameworks can disproportionately affect startups and smaller enterprises, consolidating technological power within a few large corporations. 
        Innovations in critical fields such as healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability rely heavily on AI advancements, and over-regulation could delay or derail life-saving breakthroughs. 
        Research by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (2020) emphasizes that flexible, adaptive policies are essential to promote competitiveness and maintain leadership in AI development. 
        A blanket regulatory approach may inadvertently discourage risk-taking, research investment, and creative problem-solving.</p>

    <section>
        <p>Another major concern is global competitiveness. 
        Countries with overly restrictive AI regulations risk falling behind more agile economies like China or South Korea, where lighter-touch policies have accelerated technological adoption. 
        Without harmonized international guidelines, innovation could shift to jurisdictions with minimal oversight, undermining the very goals regulation seeks to achieve. 
        Policymakers must therefore carefully balance ethical safeguards with economic incentives, ensuring that protective measures do not unintentionally cede technological leadership. 
        A smart regulatory framework should support ethical AI development while preserving the conditions necessary for sustainable innovation and economic growth.</p>

        <h3>Risks of Over-Regulating AI:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Innovation Slowdown:</strong> Excessive rules deter research, development, and entrepreneurship.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Disadvantages:</strong> High compliance costs favor large corporations and limit competition.</li>
            <li><strong>Global Talent Drain:</strong> Strict regulations can drive AI talent and companies to more flexible countries.</li>
            <li><strong>Missed Opportunities:</strong> Over-regulation can delay medical, environmental, and educational AI advancements.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic Risk:</strong> Losing AI leadership threatens national security and economic power.</li>
        </ul>
